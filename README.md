# covid19-analysis
ðŸ¦  COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
This project explores the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using publicly available datasets. It provides insightful visualizations and statistics, offering a clear view of how the virus spread across countries over time.

 Objective
To analyze worldwide COVID-19 data with a focus on:

Confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths

Country-wise and global trends over time

Comparative analysis of the most affected countries

 Dataset
Source: [Johns Hopkins University / Kaggle COVID-19 Dataset]

Features:

Date

Country/Region

Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered

Time Span: From early 2020 onward

 Technologies Used
 
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
Pandas for data manipulation

NumPy for numerical operations

Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations

 Exploratory Data Analysis
 Key Analyses Performed:
Total confirmed, death, and recovered cases globally

Time series analysis: How numbers changed day-by-day

Top 10 affected countries (by total confirmed cases)

Recovery and fatality rates

Heatmaps, bar plots, and line plots for better understanding

 Visual Highlights
Line Plot: Growth of confirmed cases over time

Bar Chart: Country-wise comparison

Pie Chart: Distribution of active, recovered, and death cases

Heatmap: Correlation between variables

 Key Insights
COVID-19 growth was exponential in early 2020.

A few countries account for the majority of global cases.

Recovery rates varied significantly across regions.

Data-driven visuals help reveal trends that raw numbers obscure.

 Future Improvements
Forecast future cases using time series modeling (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet)

Include vaccination data and variant-based analysis

Deploy a dashboard (using Streamlit or Dash)
